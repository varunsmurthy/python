### sorted()

* The easiest way to sort is with the sorted(list) function, which takes a list and returns a new list with those elements in sorted order.
* It can take as input any sort of iterable collection. 
* Custom Sorting With key=fn, where fn is either a built-in or user defined function which converts each list member into a number.

### listVar.sort()

* The sort() method changes the underlying list and returns None.
* Operates only on lists.

### Tuples

* A tuple is a fixed size grouping of elements, such as an (x, y) co-ordinate. 
* Immutable.

### List comprehensions

* listVar = [ expr for var in list ] -- note the lack of a semi-colon.
* You can add an if test to the right of the for-loop to narrow the result.
