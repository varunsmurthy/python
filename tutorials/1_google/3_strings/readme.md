### Python strings

* Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style).  
But also, check this: http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#other-languages-have-variables and  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9097994/arent-python-strings-immutable.

* Unlike Java, the '+' does not automatically convert numbers or other types to string form. The str() function converts values to a string form so they can be combined with other strings.  

### String methods

* A method is like a function, but it runs "on" an object. May or may not take input arguments (e.g. strVar.lower() vs strVal.replace(old,new)

### String slices

* The slice s[start:end] is the elements beginning at start and extending up to but not including end.
* Can be positive or negative. When positive.

### String %

* strVar = "%d is the %s" %(intVar, stringVar)

### If statement
