* List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. Lists work similarly to strings -- use the len() function and square brackets [ ] to access data, with the first element at index 0.

* Assignment with an = on lists does not make a copy. Instead, assignment makes the two variables point to the one list in memory.

### For and In

* You can also use for/in to work on a string. The string acts like a list of its chars. 

### Range

* The range(n) function yields the numbers 0, 1, ... n-1, and range(a, b) returns a, a+1, ... b-1 -- up to but not including the last number.

### While loop

### List methods

* Remember that these act on the list variables (i.e., listVar.append()). Also these methods don't return the list, but modify the list.

* Slicing works on lists too, similar to strings.
