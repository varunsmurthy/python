Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style).  
But also, check this: http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#other-languages-have-variables and  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9097994/arent-python-strings-immutable.

Unlike Java, the '+' does not automatically convert numbers or other types to string form. The str() function converts values to a string form so they can be combined with other strings.
